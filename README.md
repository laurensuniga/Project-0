Name of the game: This means war!

User Story:

The goal of the game is to have all the cards in your possession.

The player begins the game by pushing lets play!

Both players flip over their top card at the same time.
To do so the Player must hit the flip card button.

The player with the higher value card wins. Suits do not matter in this game.

If the two cards that have been flipped are the same then both players pull out another card face down and another card face up.
The higher card wins and takes all of the cards that were just played.
If the two flipped cards are once again the same, the process of one face up and one face down card repeats.

The game ends once either the Player or the Computer has all of the cards or someone runs out of cards.



# MVP:

* The game I want to make is the card game war. 

* Two players. One human and one cpu.

* I want to allow the Player to control most of the game and when the player pushes a buttom to flip a card it'll trigger the computer to flip their card as well since the two cards need to be flipped at the same time. 

* If two cards pop up and they are the same then a pop up screen pops up that signifies its time to go to war.

* There will be a button on the pop up that will trigger a face up and face down card to be pulled from the deck.


# Strech Goals

* Creating the game to have a nicer design over all.
