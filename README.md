Name of the game: This means war!

User Story:

The goal of the game is to have all the cards in your possession.

The player begins the game by pushing lets play!

Both players flip over their top card at the same time.
To do so the Player must hit the flip card button.

The player with the higher value card wins. Suits do not matter in this game.

If the two cards that have been flipped are the same then both players pull out another card face down and another card face up.
The higher card wins and takes all of the cards that were just played.
If the two flipped cards are once again the same, the process of one face up and one face down card repeats.

The game ends once either the Player or the Computer has all of the cards or someone runs out of cards.



# MVP: 

* Two players. One human and one cpu.

* I want to allow the Player to control most of the game.

* Rules button that will have the rules appear and disappear when clicked.

* When the player pushes a buttom to flip a card it'll trigger the computer to flip their card as well since the two cards need to be flipped at the same time. 

* When the two cards are the same then the game will automatically pull out two more cards for each player.

* The game will then compare the face up cards and give the player with the higher card all the currently played cards
